# nvidia-driverupdate-selenium
Selenium tool that downloads a driver for NVIDIA GPUs when given parameters

What does the tool do?
The tool uses a python script to ask for user's NVIDIA GPU specs and clicks through the website to get the latest version (coming soon). It also stores the version that was downloaded and stops the process if the version number has not changed (coming soon).

Current version: 1.0, only downloads drivers for a MX230 driver, without checking for a version.
Will add future variations

This tool was made as a small project, so find something better than this. This is just a testing ground to learn Selenium and Python.
